## 🚀 Setup Steps (Since you already have a Resend account)

### Step 1: Get Your API Key
1. Go to [Resend Dashboard](https://resend.com/api-keys)
2. Click "Create API Key"
3. Name it something like "Next.js Contact Form"
4. Select "Sending access" permission
5. Copy the API key (you'll only see it once!)

### Step 2: Update Environment Variables
1. Open `.env.local` in your project root
2. Replace `your_resend_api_key_here` with your actual API key:
```bash
RESEND_API_KEY=re_your_actual_api_key_here
```

### Step 3: Verify Your Domain (Important!)
1. Go to [Resend Domains](https://resend.com/domains)
2. Click "Add Domain"
3. Enter your domain (e.g., `yourdomain.com` or `mail.yourdomain.com`)
4. Add the DNS records Resend provides to your domain provider
5. Wait for verification (usually takes a few minutes)

### Step 4: Update Email Configuration
Once your domain is verified, update the API route:
1. Open `app/api/contact/route.ts`
2. Change line 32 from:
```typescript
from: 'Contact Form <onboarding@resend.dev>',
```
To:
```typescript
from: 'Contact Form <noreply@yourdomain.com>',
```

## 🧪 How to Test

4. Fill out the form and submit
5. Check your Gmail inbox (arsalmaab@gmail.com)

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

**If emails aren't sending:**

1. **Check API Key**: Make sure it's correctly set in `.env.local`
2. **Restart Server**: After changing `.env.local`, restart `npm run dev`
3. **Check Console**: Look for errors in browser console and terminal
4. **Domain Verification**: Until domain is verified, emails will come from `onboarding@resend.dev`

**Common Error Solutions:**

- `RESEND_API_KEY is not configured` → Check your `.env.local` file
- `Failed to send email` → Check if API key is valid and has correct permissions
- `Domain not verified` → Complete domain verification in Resend dashboard
