#Instructions

1. When performing any coding task or implementing changes, you must:

- Prioritize performance at every step.
- Ensure all solutions are optimized and non-complex.
- Keep the app or website snappy and lightning fast.
- Avoid unnecessary complexity or heavy operations.
**This is the most important requirement for all development work.**

2. After every change make sure to add all changes with git "add ." and commit with a meaningful, detailed message about the changes you made to my local repo. Make sure the message is abit descriptive and detailed. not too  long though.
**You must not push the changes to remote rep this is very important**

3. You must never switch the model to Gemini 2.5 flash. Always use Gemini 2.5 pro
