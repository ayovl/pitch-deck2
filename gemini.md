#Instructions

1. When performing any coding task or implementing changes, you must:

- Prioritize performance at every step.
- Ensure all solutions are optimized and non-complex.
- Keep the app or website snappy and lightning fast.
- Avoid unnecessary complexity or heavy operations.

**This is the most important requirement for all development work.**
2. After every change make sure to add all changes with git "add ." and commit with a meaningful message about the changes you made. but don't push them
